Welcome to the Nibble framework
===============================
The Nibble framework is designed to be an easy, simple to develop for
framework.  All of the applications developed are developed as plug-ins,
this means that there is no need to edit any of the files in any of the
folders except those in the plug-in folder that is under development.
Hopefully this will be a process that most developers do not find to
complicated.

The core library of the framework is set to have many useful functions
that are necessary for development without overloading on functionality
that in most cases is not used.  This means that the framework can be kept
nice and light weight.

There are also some plug-ins under development;

- User  The user plug-in is a simple authentication plug-in that allows
areas of the site to be assigned to certain user groups, users to be added
to user groups (assigned permissions) etc.
- Blog  The blog plug-in is a compact blogging tool, there is a full
markdown editor avaliable for post creation.  Users can be allowed to
create posts and comment on posts
- Blog enhancements  A number of plug-ins are under development to
enhance the blog plug-in (i.e post caching, post rating). These are being
developed as separate plug-ins so that they can be activated and de-activated
by the user allowing for a customisable blog.

### Installing
Installing the Nibble framework is easy, there is a setup script that will guide
you through the process once you have uploaded the files to the server.  
The two requirements before this stage are

1. Setting up a database and knowing the login credentials
2. Pointing your server to the web directory as the target so that lib, bites
and templates folders are in the root and not avaliable to the public 
(this is a very simple process with most competent web hosting providers)

Once these two requirements are met, ftp or deploy the software to the server
and open up a web browser to the domain.  A simple setup routine asking for
database information and siteadministration details is then run.  After this
your site is up and running.

### Feedback
Please feedback if you use the system and find any bugs or think of any
enhancements.  Feedback can be left using the contact form at
